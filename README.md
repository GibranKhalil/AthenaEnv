## About

AthenaEnv runs modern JavaScript on the PlayStation 2. Scripts are executed by
a PS2-tuned build of [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) and reach the
hardware through native modules: GS rendering, VU1-accelerated tilemaps, IPU
video decoding, SPU2 audio, controllers, storage, threads and physics.

Every feature is a **module** that can be left out of the build. A game ships
only what it uses, so the binary and its RAM footprint stay small. The same
modules can also be used from C, without the JavaScript engine.

Highlights:

- **Game loop with native timing**: `Loop.run()` provides the frame delta,
  fixed-step updates for physics, time scaling and frame statistics.
- **2D rendering**: primitives, textured images, TrueType and bitmap fonts,
  and a VU1-batched tilemap renderer for thousands of sprites.
- **Asynchronous assets**: images, sound effects and archives load on worker
  threads without stalling the frame.
- **Memory card saves**: JSON saves that survive a pulled card, awaitable
  without dropping frames, and `icon.sys` generation for the PS2 browser.
- **Box2D 3.2 physics** with a debug renderer.
- **MPEG-1/2 video** decoded by the IPU and usable as a texture.
- **Up to eight players**: PS2 pads, multitaps, DualShock 3/4 over USB and
  Bluetooth.
- **TypeScript declarations** for every module, generated for your exact build.

## Getting started

### 1. Get a build

Download `AthenaEnv.tar.gz` from the [Releases](https://github.com/GibranKhalil/AthenaEnv/releases)
page, or [build it yourself](#building-from-source). The archive contains the
`bin/` folder:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `athena.elf` | The runtime. |
| `athena_debug.elf` | Unstripped build with debug logging. |
| `athena.ini` | Boot configuration: which script to run, which drivers to start. |
| `main.js` | The default entry script. |
| `athena.d.ts`, `jsconfig.json` | Editor completion for every module of the build. |
| `tests/` | Module tests and examples. |

### 2. Write a script

Replace `main.js` with:

```js
const font = new Font();

Loop.run(() => {
    font.print(20, 20, "Hello, PS2!");
});
```

`Loop.run()` clears the screen, calls your function and presents the frame,
once per vertical blank.

### 3. Run it

- **PCSX2**: enable the host filesystem in the emulator settings, then boot
  `athena.elf` from the `bin/` folder. The emulator console shows
  `console.log()` messages and errors.
- **PS2**: copy the `bin/` folder to a USB drive or memory card and start
  `athena.elf` with an ELF launcher such as wLaunchELF.

Uncaught errors are shown on screen with their stack trace. Hardware
exceptions, such as an invalid memory access in native code, show an
exception screen with the CPU registers and the faulting function.

## Writing scripts

### Globals and imports

Every module of the build is available as a global (`Screen`, `Draw`,
`Gamepad`...). Modules can also be imported explicitly, which documents the
dependencies of a file:

```js
import * as Screen from "Screen";
import { Font } from "Font";
```

`Font`, `Image`, `ImageList` and `Video` are classes; the other modules are
namespaces of functions and constants. QuickJS's `std` and `os` modules are
global as well, together with `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setImmediate` and
their `clear*` counterparts.

Your own files are regular ES modules:

```js
// utils.js
export const clamp = (value, min, max) => Math.min(Math.max(value, min), max);

// main.js
import { clamp } from "utils.js";
```

The QuickJS version in use (2021-03-27) has no top-level `await`: use it
inside an `async` function.

### Editor support

`bin/athena.d.ts` declares the API of every module in the build, with
documentation for each function. `bin/jsconfig.json` enables it in Visual
Studio Code and other editors that understand TypeScript declarations; no
TypeScript is required.

### The game loop

`Loop.run()` is the recommended way to drive a game. It takes a function, or an
object with `update` and `draw`:

```js
const pad = Gamepad.player(0);
const WHITE = Color.new(255, 255, 255);
let x = 320;

Loop.run(dt => {                       // dt: seconds since the previous frame
    Gamepad.update();
    x += pad.leftX * 200 * dt;         // 200 pixels per second at any frame rate
    Draw.rect(x, 200, 32, 32, WHITE);
});
```

```js
Loop.run({
    update(step) { world.step(step, 4); },   // 0..N times per frame, with a constant step
    draw(alpha) { Box2DDraw.draw(world); },  // once per frame
}, { fixedStep: 1 / 60 });
```

Options: `clear`, `clearColor`, `maxDelta`, `fixedStep`, `maxSteps` and
`vsyncInterval` (`2` holds a steady 30 FPS on NTSC). `Loop.setTimeScale()`
slows down or pauses game time, and `Loop.getStats()` reports the FPS and the
CPU time spent per frame.

Modules and games register per-frame work once as **systems**, which run
around the handlers every frame, by priority, until they are removed:

```js
Loop.addSystem({
    name: "hud",
    priority: 100,
    realTime: true,                        // keeps running with setTimeScale(0)
    postUpdate(dt) { /* animate */ },
    postDraw() { font.print(20, 20, `FPS ${Loop.getStats().fps | 0}`); },
});
```

The phases are `preUpdate(dt)`, `update(step)` (with each handler update),
`postUpdate(dt)`, `preDraw(alpha)` and `postDraw(alpha)`; C modules register
systems through `<athena/loop.h>`.

Unlike a `while (true)` loop, `Loop.run()` returns immediately and frames start
once the script ends, so timers, promises and `async` functions keep running
between frames. A manual loop is still possible:

```js
while (true) {
    Screen.clear();
    // draw...
    Screen.flip();
}
```

### Switching scripts

`std.reload(path)` ends the running script and starts another one in a fresh
JavaScript VM, without restarting the ELF: a title screen can start the game,
a menu can start a level pack. Nothing after the call runs; a path that
cannot be opened throws instead.

```js
std.reload("game/main.js");                                // switch for good
std.reload("tests/box2d_test.js", { returnTo: "menu.js" }); // come back afterwards
```

With `returnTo`, the new script returns to that one when it ends, throws, or
the player holds SELECT+START for a second, and `std.lastRun()` tells how it
went: `{ script, status, error, output }` with `status` `"finished"`,
`"error"`, `"exited"` (SELECT+START) or `"reloaded"`, and `output` the last
16 KiB it printed with `console.log()` or `print()`. State kept by native code, such as
loaded IOP drivers or the enabled gamepad drivers, is not reset between
scripts.

### Paths and devices

Paths are relative to the folder AthenaEnv was started from, or absolute with a
device prefix: `mass:/` (USB), `mc0:/` and `mc1:/` (memory cards), `cdrom0:`
(disc) and `host:` (the PC folder, **PCSX2 only**). `System.listDir()` and
`System.devices()` explore them.

### Numbers and memory

- `15.0f` is a single-precision float literal, and `Math.fround()` returns
  real single floats. The EE's FPU only computes in 32 bits.
- The JavaScript heap is limited to half of the RAM free at start-up.
  `System.getMemoryStats()` reports the binary size, the native heap, the
  QuickJS heap and its limit; `bin/tests/memory_stats.js` shows them on
  screen.
- Pixels, textures and glyphs live outside the JavaScript heap, so the
  collector cannot tell how much memory an unused `Image` or `Font` holds.
  Call `free()` on the ones you are done with (at a scene change, for
  example), and `std.gc()` on loading screens. Loading an image or font that
  runs out of memory collects garbage and tries once more.
- Deep recursion throws a catchable `InternalError: stack overflow` before it
  can overrun the stack: the main thread has 512 KB (`MAIN_STACK_SIZE` in the
  Makefile; about 1200 levels of JavaScript recursion), and `Thread.new()`
  threads 32 KB by default.

### Background jobs

Slow work runs on a small pool of worker threads while frames keep coming:
reading and writing memory card files, extracting archives, loading sound
effects and fonts. Every `*Async` function returns a job, with the same API
in every module:

```js
async function load() {
    const font = await Font.loadAsync("fonts/title.ttf", { size: 40 });   // await it...
    const save = await MemoryCard.readJSONAsync("mc0:/MYGAME/save.json");
    return { font, save };
}

const job = Archive.extractAsync("dlc.zip", "mass:/GAME/dlc");
Loop.run(() => {
    const status = job.poll();          // ...or poll it: { state, result | error, ...progress }
    if (status.state === "running") drawBar(status.bytesDone / status.bytesTotal);
});
```

`job.wait(timeoutMs)` blocks until it settles and `job.cancel()` stops it;
`MemoryCard.poll(job)`, `Archive.wait(job)` and the like do the same. Jobs
that wait for the IOP (memory card, disc, USB) run above the script thread,
the ones that use the CPU (decompression) below it. C modules submit their
own kinds of jobs through `<athena/job.h>` and expose them with
`<athena/js/job.h>`.

## Modules

The default build contains every module except `box2d`, `box2ddraw`, `erl`, `hdd`, `ilink` and `mx4sio`.
Each module's API is documented in its TypeScript declaration, linked in the
tables below.

### Graphics

| Module | Global | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`screen`](src/modules/screen/screen.d.ts) | `Screen` | Video modes, clear and flip, VSync, FPS, VRAM statistics and GS state (alpha, depth, scissor). |
| [`loop`](src/modules/loop/loop.d.ts) | `Loop` | Runtime-driven game loop: frame delta, fixed steps, time scale, frame pacing and statistics. |
| [`draw`](src/modules/draw/draw.d.ts) | `Draw` | Points, lines, rectangles, circles, triangles and quads, flat or Gouraud shaded. |
| [`color`](src/modules/color/color.d.ts) | `Color` | Packing and editing of RGBA colors. |
| [`image`](src/modules/image/image.d.ts) | `Image` | PNG, JPEG and BMP loading, pixel access and textured drawing with tint, source rectangle and rotation; `drawList()` draws many sprites of one texture at once. |
| [`imagelist`](src/modules/imagelist/imagelist.d.ts) | `ImageList` | Asynchronous image loading with priorities, deduplication, an LRU cache and an optional decoder thread. |
| [`font`](src/modules/font/font.d.ts) | `Font` | TrueType and bitmap fonts at any size, loaded on a worker with `Font.loadAsync()`, glyphs preloaded a slice per frame with `preload()`, and cached layouts with `render()`; multi-line text, kerning, alignment, outline and drop shadow, with square glyphs on NTSC, PAL, 480p and 16:9. |
| [`tilemap`](src/modules/tilemap/tilemap.d.ts) | `TileMap` | VU1-accelerated batched sprites and tilemaps. |
| [`video`](src/modules/video/video.d.ts) | `Video` | MPEG-1/2 playback on the IPU, drawn directly or used as an `Image`. See [docs/VIDEO.md](docs/VIDEO.md). |
| `graphics` | — | GS initialization and the rendering core shared by the modules above. |

```js
const logo = new Image("logo.png");
const font = new Font("fonts/title.ttf", { size: 40 });   // rasterized at 40 px

Loop.run(() => {
    logo.draw(100, 80);
    font.print(100, 300, "Press START\nto continue");
}, { clearColor: Color.new(20, 20, 40) });
```

`image.drawList()` takes the sprite records of `TileMap.SpriteBuffer` (x, y,
w, h, u1, v1, u2, v2, r, g, b, a): the texture state goes out once per 128
sprites instead of once per `draw()`, for particles, bullets and tiles that
change every frame. Fonts share glyph caches between equal loads (same file
and size); at most 16 different ones are loaded at a time, so `free()` the
ones no longer used.

### Input

| Module | Global | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`gamepad`](src/modules/gamepad/gamepad.d.ts) | `Gamepad` | Up to eight players: DualShock 2 on both ports and multitaps, DualShock 3/4 over USB and Bluetooth. Buttons, sticks, pressure and rumble. |

```js
Gamepad.configure({ multitap: true });   // optional drivers: multitap, usb, bluetooth
const pad = Gamepad.player(0);

Loop.run(() => {
    Gamepad.update();                    // once per frame
    if (pad.justPressed(Gamepad.CROSS)) pad.rumble(0.5, 0, 200);
});
```

### Audio

| Module | Global | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`sound`](src/modules/sound/sound.d.ts) | `Sound` | ADPCM sound effects on the 24 SPU2 voices, loaded sync or on a worker with `Sound.loadSfxAsync()`, and one streamed WAV or Ogg Vorbis music track, with fades. |

```js
const music = new Sound.Stream("music/theme.ogg");
music.loop = true;
music.play({ fade: 1000 });

const jump = new Sound.Sfx("sfx/jump.adp");   // convert WAV files with tools/wav2adp.js
const pad = Gamepad.player(0);

Loop.run(() => {
    Gamepad.update();
    if (pad.justPressed(Gamepad.CROSS)) jump.play();
    Sound.process();                          // runs the onEnd and onLoop callbacks
});
```

### Animation

Not in the default build: `node tools/modules.js configure --modules=ease,tween,...`

| Module | Global | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`ease`](src/modules/ease/ease.d.ts) | `Ease` | Easing curves (Penner families, steps, cubic-bezier) and interpolation helpers: lerp, remap, smoothstep and frame-rate independent damping. Written in JavaScript. |
| [`tween`](src/modules/tween/tween.d.ts) | `Tween` | Tweens: animate numeric and color properties of any object with easing, delays, repeats and yoyo; awaitable, driven by the Loop. Written in JavaScript. |

```js
const logo = { x: 0, y: -50 };
const camera = { x: 0 };
const WHITE = Color.new(255, 255, 255);

async function intro() {
    // Tweens are awaitable: this resolves when the drop completes.
    await Tween.to(logo, { y: 150 }, 0.8, { ease: "outBounce" });
    // Then sway between x = 0 and 200 forever.
    Tween.to(logo, { x: 200 }, 1.0, { ease: "inOutQuad", yoyo: true, repeat: Infinity });
}
intro();

Loop.run(dt => {                                      // tweens advance by themselves
    camera.x = Ease.damp(camera.x, logo.x, 8, dt);   // same follow speed at 30 and 60 FPS
    Draw.rect(320 + logo.x - camera.x, logo.y, 32, 32, WHITE);
});
```

`Tween.to()` also interpolates packed colors per channel (`colors: ["tint"]`),
and `realTime: true` keeps menu animations running while
`Loop.setTimeScale(0)` pauses the game.

### Physics

Not in the default build; see [docs/BOX2D.md](docs/BOX2D.md).

| Module | Global | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`box2d`](src/modules/box2d/box2d.d.ts) | `Box2D` | Box2D 3.2: worlds, bodies, five shape types, chains, seven joint types, ray and shape casts, overlap queries, character movers, events and snapshots. |
| [`box2ddraw`](src/modules/box2ddraw/box2ddraw.d.ts) | `Box2DDraw` | Debug drawing of a Box2D world. |

### Math

| Module | Global | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`vector`](src/modules/vector/vector.d.ts) | `Vector` | `Vector2`, `Vector3` and `Vector4` with PS2 alignment. |
| [`matrix4`](src/modules/matrix4/matrix4.d.ts) | `Matrix4` | 4×4 transformation matrices. |

### System and storage

| Module | Global | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`system`](src/modules/system/system.d.ts) | `System` | Files and folders, devices, hardware information, memory statistics, timing, garbage collection and launching ELFs. Always included. |
| [`archive`](src/modules/archive/archive.d.ts) | `Archive` | Reads zip, tar, tar.gz and gzip; safe extraction, also on a worker thread; gzip in memory. |
| [`iop`](src/modules/iop/iop.d.ts) | `IOP` | IOP driver discovery, loading, reset and memory statistics. |
| [`memcard`](src/modules/memcard/memcard.d.ts) | `MemoryCard` | Memory cards on `mc0:/` and `mc1:/`: card status and swap detection, files (whole, JSON or streamed), directories, attributes and dates, atomic saves, `icon.sys`, format, and every slow call also as an awaitable background job. Also the drivers the memory card boot device needs. |
| `usbmass` | — | USB storage drivers (`mass:/`). |
| `mx4sio` | — | MX4SIO (SD card adapter in memory card slot 2) drivers (`mass:/`). Not in the default build; slot 2 no longer reads memory cards while it is loaded. |
| `hdd` | — | Internal hard disk drivers for exFAT/FAT32 disks, not PFS (`mass:/`). Not in the default build. |
| `ilink` | — | i.LINK (IEEE 1394) storage drivers (`mass:/`), on the consoles that have the port. Not in the default build. |
| `cdrom` | — | Disc filesystem driver (`cdrom0:`). |
| `poweroff` | — | IOP power-off driver. |

USB, MX4SIO, the internal HDD and i.LINK all appear as `mass:/` through the
same BDM drivers. When booting from `mass:`, the drivers of every one of
these modules in the build are started, the one holding the boot folder is
found, and only that one is kept.

```js
// Read a file straight from a zip, without extracting it.
const pack = Archive.open("assets.zip");
const bytes = new Uint8Array(Archive.read(pack, "levels/1.json"));
Archive.close(pack);
```

```js
// Save and load a game. The *Async calls run on a worker thread, so the frame
// loop keeps drawing; atomic saves keep the previous save if the card is pulled.
const SAVE = "mc0:/MYGAME/save.json";

async function save(state) {
    try {
        await MemoryCard.writeJSONAsync(SAVE, state, { atomic: true });  // creates mc0:/MYGAME
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(`Save failed: ${error.code}`);                      // NO_CARD, FULL, CARD_CHANGED...
    }
}

async function load() {
    if (!MemoryCard.getInfo(0).connected) return null;
    return MemoryCard.exists(SAVE) ? await MemoryCard.readJSONAsync(SAVE) : null;
}

// The PS2 browser shows a save directory that has an icon.sys and its icon.
MemoryCard.writeFile("mc0:/MYGAME/icon.sys",
    MemoryCard.createIconSys({ title: "My Game\nSlot 1", icon: "icon.ico" }));
```

Three files can be open at once on both cards together, `fopen("mc0:...")`
included, and each directory holds a fixed number of entries. A handle opened
before the card was swapped or the IOP was reset is refused instead of writing
to the wrong card. `bin/tests/memcard_example.js` is a complete save/load
screen.

### Concurrency and timing

| Module | Global | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`thread`](src/modules/thread/thread.d.ts) | `Thread` | EE threads with stack and priority control, recursion limit protection, and the worker pool behind background jobs. |
| [`mutex`](src/modules/mutex/mutex.d.ts) | `Mutex` | Mutual exclusion for data shared between threads. |
| [`timer`](src/modules/timer/timer.d.ts) | `Timer` | Pausable elapsed-time timers. |

```js
const mutex = Mutex.new();
let counter = 0;

const worker = Thread.new(() => {
    Mutex.lock(mutex);
    counter++;
    Mutex.unlock(mutex);
}, "worker", 32768);

Thread.start(worker);
```

Callbacks execute preemptively on native EE threads and share the QuickJS
runtime through an internal lock (the GIL); deeper recursion throws a
catchable `InternalError: stack overflow` instead of overrunning the stack
(`bin/tests/stack_test.js`). For I/O and heavy decoding, prefer the
[Background jobs](#background-jobs) pool (`*Async`).

### Native modules

| Module | Global | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `erl` | — | Loads relocatable native modules (`.erl`) at runtime. Not in the default build; see [Native code](#native-code). |

## Configuration

`athena.ini`, next to `athena.elf`, is read at boot:

```ini
# Script to run (default: main.js)
default_script=main.js

# IOP drivers to start at boot, by name (see IOP.getModules())
audsrv = true
```

Command-line arguments, for launchers that pass them, override it:

| Argument | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--script=<path>`, `-s=<path>` | Run another script. |
| `--cfg=<path>`, `-c=<path>` | Read another configuration file. |
| `--ignorecfg`, `-i` | Do not read the configuration file. |
| `--noiopreset`, `-n` | Keep the IOP drivers loaded by the launcher. |

When booted from a disc, the configuration file is `cdrom0:ATHENA.INI;1`.

## Building from source

The simplest way is Docker, which provides the PS2 toolchain:

```shell
docker compose run --rm build   # bin/athena.elf (and bin/athena_pkd.elf when ps2-packer is available)
docker compose run --rm debug   # bin/athena_debug.elf
```

### Choosing modules

Only the selected modules, their dependencies and the required ones are
compiled and linked:

```shell
node tools/modules.js list                                     # available modules
node tools/modules.js configure --defaults                     # the default build
node tools/modules.js configure --modules=screen,loop,gamepad   # a custom selection
node tools/modules.js configure --all                          # everything
```

`configure` regenerates `Makefile.modules`, `src/generated/` and
`bin/athena.d.ts`. Boot devices are modules too: a build that runs from USB can
drop `memcard` and `cdrom` to save RAM, while builds booting from SD card
adapters or internal storage include `mx4sio`, `hdd` or `ilink`. A build without
the driver of its boot device cannot read its own scripts.

Local builds with a ps2dev toolchain, build options and the C library are
described in [docs/BUILDING_ATHENA.md](docs/BUILDING_ATHENA.md).

### Adding a module

A module is a folder in `src/modules/<id>/`:

```
src/modules/<id>/
├── module.json        # id, description, dependencies, sources, QuickJS binding
├── include/athena/    # public C API
├── native/            # C implementation, independent of JavaScript
├── quickjs/           # JavaScript binding
├── js/                # JavaScript implementation, for modules written in JavaScript
└── <id>.d.ts          # TypeScript declaration
```

The native part never depends on QuickJS, so every module is usable from C.

#### JavaScript modules

Code that organizes a game (scenes, menus, tweens) gains nothing from C. A
module can be written in JavaScript instead, and is embedded in the binary,
selected, typed and made global like any other:

```json
{
  "id": "scene",
  "name": "Scene",
  "dependencies": { "modules": ["loop", "imagelist"] },
  "js": { "source": "js/scene.js", "module_name": "Scene", "global_alias": "Scene" },
  "types": "scene.d.ts"
}
```

- `source` is one ES module file. It is embedded as text and compiled the
  first time it is imported, so its errors report `Scene:<line>`.
- Import what it uses (`import * as Loop from "Loop"`): the globals of other
  modules are assigned only after every module has been evaluated. Relative
  imports are resolved on the boot device, not in the binary.
- `global_export` works as for QuickJS bindings, e.g. `"Scene.Scene"` to make
  a class the global.
- A module may have both a QuickJS binding and a JavaScript part, with
  different module names: the fast path in C, the rest in JavaScript. JavaScript
  modules only exist with `RUNTIME=quickjs`; C code never depends on them.

## Native code

### Native runtime

AthenaEnv can be built without the JavaScript engine. Your C code implements
`int athena_main(int argc, char **argv)` and uses the modules through their C
headers; boot, IOP drivers and exception handling work as in the JavaScript
runtime.

```shell
make RUNTIME=native APP_SRCS=samples/native/hello/main.c   # bin/athena_native.elf
make lib RUNTIME=native                                    # lib/libathena.a for other projects
```

See `samples/native/` and [docs/BUILDING_ATHENA.md](docs/BUILDING_ATHENA.md).

### ERL modules

With the `erl` module in the build, scripts can load native code compiled as a
relocatable `.erl` module:

```js
import * as CustomModule from "custom_module.erl";
console.log(CustomModule.fibonacci(20));
```

`native_module_template/` contains a buildable example. The `erl` module
exports every symbol of the binary, which costs RAM and disables dead-code
removal, so it is off by default.

## Testing

| Command | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `docker compose run --rm host-tests` | C tests of the runtime and modules on the build machine (`tests/host/`). |
| `docker compose run --rm js-tests` | Module test scripts under AddressSanitizer (`tests/js/`). |

JavaScript modules (`src/modules/<name>/js/`) are loaded directly from their
source by the test runner (`tests/js/runner.c`), using a JavaScript stub for
`Loop` (`tests/js/stub/Loop.js`) because the real `Loop` requires GS
initialization.

`bin/tests/` holds test scripts and examples to run on PCSX2 or a PS2.
`bin/tests/index.js` is a launcher for them, and `bin/athena.ini` starts it
(`default_script=tests/index.js`), so switching tests needs no edit:

- **✕** runs the selected script, **UP/DOWN** move, **LEFT/RIGHT** turn a page.
- A script returns to the launcher when it ends, when it throws, or when
  **SELECT+START** is held for a second on the pad in port 1. The shortcut
  works in every script, including `while (true)` loops and scripts that
  never read the pad.
- Back in the launcher, what the script printed (`console.log()`, `print()`,
  unhandled promise rejections) and its error with the stack trace are shown
  on screen, scrolled to the end where test summaries are: failures in red,
  passes in green. **UP/DOWN** scroll, **LEFT/RIGHT** turn a page, **✕** or
  **○** go back to the list, and **△** shows it again. The last 16 KiB are
  kept; the same output still goes to the EE console (the PCSX2 log).

Scripts run one after another in the same ELF, so native state that outlives
a script (loaded IOP drivers, enabled gamepad drivers) carries over.
Tests that check a fresh start, such as `gamepad_test.js`, are only reliable
as the first script after boot. Key test suites in `bin/tests/` include
`stack_test.js` (recursion and stack limits), `font_async_test.js` (font
rasterization and async jobs), `memcard_test.js` (synchronous and async saves)
and `memory_stats.js`.

`soak_test.js` checks that switching scripts does not leak or hang: it runs
the heavy scripts of `bin/tests/soak/` (fonts, sound, ImageList, video, jobs,
threads) six times in a row, each one switching back with `std.reload()` in
the middle of its work, and compares the EE heap and VRAM at the start of
every round. It keeps its progress in `bin/tests/soak/state.json`, so run it
from a writable device (USB or `host:`), and reports in the launcher when
done.

Test on real hardware before a release: the emulator tolerates misaligned
memory accesses and provides the `host:` device, which a console does not.
